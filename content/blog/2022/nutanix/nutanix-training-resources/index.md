With Nutanix you can build groundbreaking and state-of-the-art IT infrastructures. In this blog post, I have collected various resources for training and certification.  

## Certifications and Exams
There are four levels of certification, Associate, Professional, Master and Expert. 


The entry-level is **Associate**. The exam consists of 50 multiple choice and multiple response questions. It is a proctored exam, online or at an exam facility. The time limit is 90 minutes.

## The Basics
Visit the [Nutanix Bible](https://www.nutanixbible.com/) website for in-depth technical information about the platform architecture. A must-read when you want to get certified! On Youtube, view these videos [here](https://youtu.be/6O7-nzXPAzs), [here](https://youtu.be/fLJIYOgyJx4) and [here](https://youtu.be/IKdzcwMY950).

Another great resource is [Nutanix University](https://www.nutanixuniversity.com/learn), where you can find dozen of free training courses and info materials. 


## Hands-on
Take a Nutanix [Test Drive](https://www.nutanix.com/one-platform) to get hands-on experience! See the [Nutanix Book of Test Drive](https://www.nutanixbible.com/9-book-of-test-drive.html) for a comprehensive explanation and guidelines.

Another option for your home lab is using the Nutanix Community Edition. This can be a single-node or three-node cluster running Nutanix AHV and AOS. Download the software [here](https://www.nutanix.com/uk/products/community-edition) or read the blogs on how to set up Community Edition [here](https://next.nutanix.com/archive-44/part-i-how-to-setup-a-three-node-nuc-nutanix-ce-cluster-15257).


## Training classes
Take an online or instructor-led training at the Nutanix University or one of the authorized Nutanix Training Centers. I recommend [Arrow Education Services](https://edu.arrow.com/nl/certificering/nutanix-certification/), but maybe I am a little biased, as there is a chance you meet me there as a future Nutanix instructor. 


## Exam preparation
