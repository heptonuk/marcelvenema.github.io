create a photorealistic 16:9 format picture with a curvy road from bottom left to upper right in a scenic landscape. On the upper right is a dark dense industrial city with chimneys. On the lower left is a sunny, organized, futuristic city with a beach and green trees. On the road is a long mover van with a lot of papers, pictures, car parts, and computer stuff. The van has a big sign with the name of 'HUGO'
